#Combinatoric selections
##Problem 53
*Published on 26 September 2003 at 06:00 pm [Server Time]*

There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, $$C^5_3 = 10$$.

In general,

$$C^n_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n−r)!},$$

where r ≤ n, n! = n×(n−1)×...×3×2×1, and 0! = 1.

It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: $$C^{23}_{10} = 1144066$$.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of  $$C^n_r,$$ for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, are greater than one-million?
